# COBOL Essentials, a Visual Studio Code extension package for Mainframe Development

## Introduction

Are you tired of reinstalling extensions on each of your computer(s)? How about when you have to reset computer entirely? Or, how about you're an instructor, a hobbyist, or just "getting your feet wet" in the fine craft of Java programming who does not know which extension(s) to select to get the job done both efficiently and effectively. Regardless, please do not waste time and energy on something so tedious as a process of installing extensions. Extensions are, in a word, awesome! Their premise is to extend the features and functionality of **Visual Studio Code**.

## What extensions will I get by downloading this extension pack?

Glad, that you've asked! Please find the supervening extensions. Of course, I always love to hear your suggestions to improve this extension package. To do so, please create a new issue in the [**Issues Section**](https://github.com/jillmnolan/cobol-essentials/issues). After all, the ultimate goal for this extension pack is convenience at the click of one button.

### Recommended Extensions for COBOL Programming

* [**IBM Z Open Editor**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.zopeneditor): A **VSCode plugin** that provides **COBOL**, **PL/I**, **HLASM language servers**, and **IBM Z development** tool.

The **Zowe Explorer** extension modernizes the way **developers** and **system administrators** interact with **z/OS mainframes** by:

  * Enabling you to create, modify, rename, copy, and upload data sets directly to a **z/OS mainframe**.
  
  * Enabling you to create, modify, rename, and upload **USS files** directly to a **z/OS mainframe**.
  
  * Providing a more streamlined way to access **data sets**, **uss files**, and **jobs**.
  
  * Letting you create, edit, and delete **Zowe CLI _zosmf_ compatible profiles**.
  
  * Letting you use the **Secure Credential Store** plugin to store your credentials securely in the settings.
